# My Python Journey in Mathematics

Welcome! I’m Mateus, a math student learning Python as a part of my first year.

## Why Python?

I chose Python for its readability and strong community support, especially with libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib for mathematical computations and visualizations.

## What I’m Learning

- **Basic Syntax**: Variables, functions, and control structures.
- **Mathematical Libraries**: NumPy, SciPy, SymPy, and Matplotlib.

## Resources

Helpful links:
- [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html)


Happy coding! 🖥️📊

Mateus
